=============

The world is on the brink of destruction. War and strife have engulfed
it. A lone monk decides to make a stand.

Flighty Monks is an arcade shooter where you pilot a monk trying to save the world. More of a
philisophical standpoint than a real game. Destroying enemies causes you to
speed up. Death replays your progress till date and places you where you died.
The speed is reset but increases as before. This goes on ad infinitum.

The win condition is achieved by not attacking enemies. Each enemy that survives
decreases your speed. When the game comes to a stop, the monk releases an aura
that destroys the world.

This is not explained when the game begins.
